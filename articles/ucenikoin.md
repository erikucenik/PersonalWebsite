I **love** blockchain technology. It's so simple yet so elegant that I'm mad at myself for never having implemented it on my own. That has to change.

# Intro

Today I'm implementing my own cryptocurrency by reading the [Bitcoin wallpaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). I'm not even going to explain how the Bitcoin protocol works, there's a million explanations out there. I will recommend however the explainer given by [Grant Sanderson from 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4). I'm such a fan of this guy, and the explanation doesn't shy out from rigor. I certainly think analogies are the wrong path to understanding Bitcoin.
