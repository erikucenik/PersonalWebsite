title: LSD, death and resurrection.
subtitle: A highschool project I made about the history and pharmacology of LSD.
---

There was this thing in my highschool where you had to spend a year or two researching about some topic of your choice and write a 30 page essay about it. So me being myself, I immediately came up with a series of dumb ideas to toe the line between good and evil, like synthesizing methamphetamine from paint thinner (don't ask).

In the end these were brief enough to not make up a full document, but one of them did stick around: LSD.

I was amazed by the stories of people who had taken it and narrated its effects. Also the fact that it had been used in therapies and could be used again. So I started researching. I had had a turbulent year, so I ended up finishing the project in about 5 months. The result is this:

# Bibliography

In my journey I would have to underline the importance of several sources like:

- [Principles of Neural Science](https://web.stanford.edu/~shenoy/GroupPublications/PNS-6thEdition-FullBook.pdf), by Eric R. Kandel et al. During some weeks my life consisted on waking up, going to school, going to the library and reading this book, page by page, until the library closed at night. It gave me a general understanding of the brain and how exogenous substances act on it, and also the neural bases for behaviour and addiction. I must admit I haven't used 70% of the information in here. To this day I'm not sure how it's going to be useful to know that "Glycine is a cofactor in the activation of NMDA receptors" in the near future. To be clear, I know this book is meant as an index to consult whatever you need, but I wanted to get a truly deep understanding.
- [Ergot and Ergotism](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/kwksaq4n/items?canvas=2). Narrating the history of ergot to as much detail as possible. It was my first insight in what it looks like to do historical research, and I've acquired an insane amount of respect for historians after this.
- [LSD - My Problem Child](https://maps.org/images/pdf/books/lsdmyproblemchild.pdf), the story of LSD told by its own creator, Albert Hofmann. From its accidental discovery to its use in arts and psychotherapy to the widespread of the hippie movement and its prohibition. What can I say, it's just a wonderful book.
- Antonio Escohotado's figure in general has had a huge role in my writing process. I haven't actually taken much information from his books, but his spirit definitely permeated my views and thoughts on the topic. Robert Sapolsky is another man I admire for similar reasons.

Anyways, I could keep rambling about [Huxley's Death Trip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BzvC2t_LeI) or [Alexander Shulgin's psychedelic experiences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PiHKAL), but I think you get the gist of it. Onto other things.
